## 🚗 Check out my first clone website - The Toyota Bakkie Hilux New Range

This project was a very exciting one for me to build. I am a big fan of Toyota Hilux Bakkies and challenged myself to build a clone version based off some similar features of the official website. This project allowed me to combine everything I have learnt thus far within the Web Development space. It includes HTML, CSS, Responsive Websites, Media Queries, SEO etc. I feel both relieved and excited having completed this project and look forward to building many more challenging projects ahead. 😁
